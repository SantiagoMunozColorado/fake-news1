<p>A growing number of people use the internet to stay informed and share millions of posts, articles, and videos across platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The rapid adoption of social media has led to a rise in information-sharing among users, with fake news becoming a component of our digital daily routines. The spread of misinformation is in part attributed to social media failing to verify the authenticity of a news item. This makes it easy to share seemingly real images and videos which have been skillfully manipulated. It is now well-known that misinformation has a significant influence on public opinion and discourse.

In this article, we explain what fake news is and how you can detect false news reports quickly.
</p>

<h2>What is fake news?</h2>

<p>The term fake news eludes to reports, images, and videos that are shared to purposefully spread misinformation i.e. information that is factually incorrect. These news items may appear authentic at first and attempt to attract attention, shock, or shape opinions. Fake news can be created by individuals or groups who are acting in their own interests or those of third parties. The creation of misinformation is usually motivated by personal, political, or economic agendas.

The sharing of fabricated news to shape public opinion on certain topics is not a recent phenomenon. Sensational headlines or political articles used to spread lies and propaganda have been around since the emergence of print media. In times of digital information exchange, fake news has become more of an online phenomenon that is difficult to control. Fake news can reach high levels of visibility in a short amount of time because it is easy to share via social media and social bots.
</p>

<h2>What types of fake news exist?</h2>

<p>Fake news is mostly used to manipulate public opinion for political or commercial gain. But false reports are also regularly used as part of sensational headlines in the form of clickbait, which aims to attract people to click through to linked websites and generate advertising income. Phishing attempsalso use simulated information and abuse the trust of internet users. Seemingly authentic contact forms are used to collect personal user data for the purpose of identity theft. Other common phenomena are email hoaxes in the form of chain mail which threaten recipients with issues in case they fail to share an email.

These are four common types of fake news:
</p>

<lu>
<li>Targeted misinformation: Fictitious piece of information shared for self-serving interests. Targeted misinformation is often directed at groups that are most susceptible to receiving this type of information and easily accept and share polarizing content without verifying its authenticity.</li>
<li>Fake headlines: Headlines depicting fictitious facts to generate attention. These are regularly employed by less credible publications such as tabloid newspapers. Readers often quickly realize that the content of the article does not match the headline. Their titles are referred to as clickbait headlines.</li>
<li>Viral posts: There is a plethora of new articles and content on social media networks. As a consequence, users often do not take the time to authenticate posts. Because large social networks favor shares, likes, and followers, popular posts are shown more often in a user is threat even if that content is fake news.</li>
<li>Satire: Satirical news pick up on current affairs and news items and mix them with fictitious, and often absurd events. Satire is often employed to raise awareness of social issues or criticize political wrongdoing. But there is always the danger that humorous components go undetected and the pieces are considered to be true.</li>
